This demo directory contains a simple quick and dirty implementation
of the sun.java2d.pipe.RenderingEngine interface.  This example is not
meant to be a viable replacement for the closed source Ductus code
in the OpenJDK, but simply serves as an example of how to build and
use an alternate RenderingEngine implementation.

The sources for this sample are in the src/sun/java2d/demo subdirectory.
A quick perusal of the sources there should uncover that this sample
RenderingEngine is not completely standalone (yet?) in that it relies
on delegation to an instance of DuctusRenderingEngine to satisfy the
requirements for 2 of the 3 methods in the RenderingEngine interface.
Some more work would be needed to create quick and dirty replacements
for those other 2 methods, but this sample is only used to demonstrate
building and runtime practices.  Hopefully a more fully featured and
faster open source alternative will be built using this guide.

To build the sample RenderingEngine, the JDK should be built in the
normal manner and then the supplied Makefile in this directory can
build this sample RenderingEngine for use with that JDK:

    % cd <toplevel>/make
    % gnumake
    # entire JDK builds
    % cd <toplevel>/src/share/demo/java2d/SampleRenderPlug
    % gnumake
    # builds RegionRE.jar

Once the RenderingEngine jar file is built, it can be used with the
following Java command line:

    % java -Xbootclasspath/a:RegionRE.jar \
        -Dsun.java2d.renderer=sun.java2d.demo.RegionRenderingEngine \
        <mainclassname> [<optional arguments>]

To run with tracing enabled, use the following Java command line:

    % java -Xbootclasspath/a:RegionRE.jar \
        -Dsun.java2d.renderer=sun.java2d.demo.RegionRenderingEngine \
        -Dsun.java2d.renderer.trace=t \
        <mainclassname> [<optional arguments>]
