# Default access control file for Remote JMX API access to monitoring.
# This file defines the allowed access for different roles.  The
# password file (jmxremote.password by default) defines the roles and
# their passwords.  To be functional, a role must have an entry in
# each file.

# You can specify a replacement access control file using the option
# -Djmx.remote.access.file=FILENAME on the command line.

# Each line in the file is blank, or a comment (like this one), or an
# access control entry.

# An access control entry consists of a role name, space, and an
# associated access level.  The role name is any string that does not
# itself contain spaces or tabs.  It corresponds to an entry in the
# password file (jmxremote.password).  The access level is one of the
# following:

# "readonly" grants access to read attributes of MBeans.  For
# monitoring, this means that a remote client in this role can read
# measurements but cannot perform any action that changes the
# environment of the running program.

# "readwrite" grants access to read and write attributes of MBeans, to
# invoke operations on them, and to create or remove them.  A remote
# client in this role can interfere with the smooth operation of the
# running program, for example by continually forcing garbage
# collection, so this access should only be granted to trusted
# clients.

# A given role should have at most one entry in this file.  If a role
# has no entry, it has no access.

# Following are two commented-out entries.  The "measure" role has
# readonly access.  The "modify" role has readwrite access.

# measure  readonly
# modify   readwrite

# DELETE THE FOLLOWING NON-COMMENTED LINES!
measure readonly
modify  readwrite
