# Default password file for Remote JMX API access to monitoring.  This
# file defines the different roles and their passwords.  The access
# control file (jmxremote.access by default) defines the allowed
# access for each role.  To be functional, a role must have an entry
# in each file.

# You can specify a replacement password file using the option
# -Djmx.remote.password.file=FILENAME on the command line.

# Each line in the file is blank, or a comment (like this one), or a
# password entry.

# A password entry consists of a role name, space, and an associated
# password.  The role name is any string that does not itself contain
# spaces or tabs.  The password is again any string that does not
# contain spaces or tabs.  Note that passwords appear in the clear in
# this file, so it is a good idea not to use valuable passwords.

# A given role should have at most one entry in this file.  If a role
# has no entry, it has no access.

# In a typical installation, this file can be read by anybody on the
# local machine, and possibly by people on other machines.  For
# security, you should either restrict the access to this file, or
# specify another, less accessible file using the
# jmx.remote.password.file property.

# Following are two commented-out entries.  The "measure" role has
# password "QED".  The "modify" role has password "R&D".

# measure  QED
# modify   R&D

# DELETE THE FOLLOWING NON-COMMENTED LINES!
measure QED
modify  R&D
